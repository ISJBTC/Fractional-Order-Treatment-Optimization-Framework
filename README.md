# Cancer Model: Modular Treatment Modeling System

A comprehensive, modular system for modeling cancer treatment dynamics using fractional calculus and advanced mathematical techniques.

## Quick Start

This project has been set up with the following structure:

```
cancer_model_project/
├── cancer_model/           # Main package
│   ├── core/              # Core mathematical models  
│   ├── protocols/         # Treatment protocols
│   ├── simulation/        # Simulation runners
│   ├── visualization/     # Plotting tools
│   └── utils/            # Utilities and main runners
├── examples/             # Ready-to-run examples
├── tests/               # Unit tests
├── results/             # Generated outputs
└── docs/               # Documentation
```

## Installation

1. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Install the package in development mode:**
```bash
pip install -e .
```

3. **Test the setup:**
```bash
python examples/test_setup.py
```

## Next Steps

1. Copy the module files into their respective directories
2. Complete the installation with `pip install -e .`
3. Run the examples to verify everything works
4. Start developing your cancer model analysis!

## Support

If you encounter any issues during setup, check:
- Python version (3.8+ required)
- Virtual environment activation
- All dependencies installed correctly
